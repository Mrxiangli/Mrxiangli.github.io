## About me

I am a second year PhD student in computer Engineering at Purdue University - West Lafayette. My research area is in the junction field of reliable edge computing and machine learning with a focus on low latency, reliable distributed system and low latency video analytics on distrbuted devices. My previous work focus on reliable low latency task offloading on hetegenous devices across heterogeneous networks, which includes both optimization problem formulation and system modeling. Moreover, my work has been carried out in physical testbed under commercial network scenarios with promising result.
