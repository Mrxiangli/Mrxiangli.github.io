## About me

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at Purdue University - West Lafayette. My research interests include optimizing machine learning algorithms for low-latency inference on edge devices, machine learning for medical imaging, and efficient LLM inference in GPU clusters.

## Education
* Ph.D Computer Engineering, Purdue University - West Lafayette, Ongoing
* B.S Computer Engineering (Distinction), Purdue University - West Lafayette

## Research Interests
My research interests are in the conjunction area of 
 *  Video analytics on low complexity edge devices
 *  Machine learning based diagnostic imaging
 *  Efficient LLM inference
